## Why I'm Learning React.js

React.js is widely used for building modern web applications. Its component-based architecture and powerful tools for managing state and UI make it essential for frontend development. As part of my journey a full-stack developer, mastering React is key to building efficient, scalable, and interactive user interfaces.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here’s a list of React.js topics I’ve learned so far:

- **React Basics**: Setting up a React project, understanding JSX, and components
- **Functional Components**: Creating components with function syntax
- **Props**: Passing data between components using props
- **State Management**: Managing state using the `useState` hook
- **Handling Events**: Handling user inputs like clicks, typing, etc.
- **Forms**: Creating and managing forms in React
- **React Router**: Setting up routing and navigation between pages
- **Hooks**: Using built-in hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and custom hooks
- **Context API**: Managing state across multiple components using context
- **Fetching Data**: Making API requests using `fetch` or Axios
- **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding component lifecycle methods with hooks

I’ll keep adding new topics as I progress in learning React.js.
